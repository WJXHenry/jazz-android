## **Local Installation Instructions:**

1. Download repo off of Github.
2. Navigate to branch you are testing on.
3. Open up the project in Android Studio
4. Add in the google-services.js file.
5. Add in the Config.java file.
6. Run the app on a device with Android API 16+.

### **Important:**
### Config.java
To get the livechat service working, you need a Java file "Config.java" that defines a "Config" object, with properties license and group. This Config.java file is located with the other Java files.

For example: 
```java
public class Config {
    public static final String group = "GROUP";
    public static final String license = "LICENSE";
}
```

### CSS
LiveChat allows you to modify the look and feel of any given group/deployment by editing CSS in the LiveChat console.
